Blockchain Patient Care System Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the Blockchain Patient Care System, highlighting its components, data flow, and role-specific access for admins, doctors, and patients.

Overview
The system is a decentralized healthcare platform integrating modern technologies for security, scalability, and real-time interaction. It comprises:

- Frontend: Flask-based web interface with AR support, blue/white/green/gray design, and accessibility (ARIA, WCAG 2.1 AA).
- Backend: Flask-based API with PostgreSQL sharding, caching, and HIPAA/GDPR compliance.
- Blockchain: Hyperledger Fabric for patient care, identity management, and payments, with IPFS for off-chain storage and Ethereum for token rewards.

Components

1. Frontend
- Technologies: Flask, Python, HTML5, JavaScript (SocketIO, A-Frame for AR), CSS (Bootstrap, FullCalendar).
- Functionality: Provides a user-friendly interface for admins, doctors, and patients, with role-specific messages and real-time updates.
  - Admin: Dashboard for network management.
  - Doctor: Patient management, prescriptions, and telemedicine.
  - Patient: Health monitoring, appointments, and chat.

2. Backend
- Technologies: Flask, SQLAlchemy (PostgreSQL), Redis, JWT, SocketIO.
- Functionality: Manages APIs, sharding (10 shards), caching, and integrations with blockchain, wearables, and notifications.
  - Sharding: Users, patients, and appointments partitioned by id % 10 for scalability.
  - Role-Specific Access: Admin (full access), Doctor (patient management), Patient (personal data).

3. Blockchain
- Technologies: Hyperledger Fabric (etcdraft consensus), IPFS, Ethereum.
- Functionality:
  - Identity Chaincode: Manages decentralized identities (DIDs) for users.
  - Patient Care Chaincode: Handles patient records, care plans, and wearables.
  - Payment Chaincode: Manages token rewards and transfers on Ethereum.
  - Off-Chain Storage: IPFS for large data (test results, wearable data).
  - Role-Specific Access: Admin (full control), Doctor (patient updates), Patient (personal access).

Data Flow
1. Frontend Requests: Users (admin, doctor, patient) interact via the web interface, sending API requests to the backend.
2. Backend Processing: The backend processes requests, queries/shards PostgreSQL, caches results, and interacts with blockchain services.
3. Blockchain Operations: Fabric chaincode (identity, patient care, payment) handles state changes, syncs with IPFS for off-chain data, and Ethereum for tokens.
4. Real-Time Updates: SocketIO broadcasts events (appointments, chats) with role-specific messages.
5. Notifications: SMS, email, and SocketIO notifications sent via the backend, tailored to roles.

Role-Specific Access
- Admin: Full access to all components, including deployment and configuration, with messages like "Thank you, Admin! ..."
- Doctor: Access to patient data, appointments, and care plans, with messages like "Great job, Doctor! ..."
- Patient: Access to personal health data, appointments, and chat, with messages like "Thank you, [Patient Name]! ..."

Scalability and Security
- Scalability: PostgreSQL sharding (10 shards), Fabric etcdraft, batching (batch_size=1000), retry logic (maxAttempts=5).
- Security: HIPAA/GDPR compliance, quantum-resistant encryption (AES-256-GCM), ECC signatures, JWT/CSRF protection, role-based access control.

Deployment Architecture
- Docker Compose: Deploys Fabric (peer, orderer), IPFS, and Ethereum nodes.
- Load Balancing: Use Nginx or HAProxy for frontend/backend scaling.
- Monitoring: Prometheus for metrics, integrated with Fabric and Ethereum.

This architecture ensures secure, scalable, and role-specific healthcare management with real-time interaction.
